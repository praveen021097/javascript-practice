//data types - there are various type of data available it is very difficult to 
// so we need to find category to categories the data in types of data 
// when you not categories the data so we face difficulty to find and perform exact operation
// there are categories in various type data types number ,string , boolean , null,undefined,

// there two types of data types 
// primitive data type - these are the fundamentals data types of any memory these are the basic building blocks
// non primitive data type - non primitive data types these are the derived data type basically its need to primitive data types 
// array,object ,enum

var data = 10;
// javascript is the loosely data types programming language because that facts comes into the picture 
// if we are talking about other language there to making any variable so we need to give the keyword 
// to of particular data type like in java int data=10;


// variables - variables is nothing but basically it is  the name of the memory block which is store the data in memory ;
// number = number is nothing but it numeric value in mathematics like digits 
//  so we categories the number into the different type float double short 

//  String - string is nothing but is is collection of words and characters 
// basically a string is store the any statement like array manner  it store the value in index form 
// and other things about string it is primitive data type and immutable data type

/*
        Booleans - booleans are nothing but it is true and false and about boolean it is very less memory taking data type its onle one bit of memory aquire
        any of variable you can provide the value it can be true and false;
        */


        /* Undefined - undefined is nothing but if something you did not defined and declare that time its showing somthing 
        is undefined 
        like var foo ;
        when you use foo it giving you in output undefined like that something is present but not assigned;
        // */

        /* null - null is nothing something available  but it is empty
